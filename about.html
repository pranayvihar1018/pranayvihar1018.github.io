            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate student currently pursuing my masters
                in Computer Science department.</p>
            <p>I am a kind of person who doesn't stay at one place
                and always seeking for adventures. I like to play
                physical games rather than online ones which helps
                me being active all the time.</p>
            <p>As far as the corporate work is concerned, I worked as
                an Application Development Associate for 18 months at
                Accenture Solutions pvt ltd. back when I was in my home
                country. Later I decided to upskill myself and wanted to
                have a cultural exposure while developing my skills so,
                that is what made me end up here.</p>
            <p>My goal in the future is to get well placed in my
                dream organization doing what I love and loving what
                I do.</p>
