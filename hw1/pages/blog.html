        <h2>Excert from the opening of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities".</h2>
        <article>
            <p>"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,
                it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
                it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,
                it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
                it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
                we had everything before us, we had nothing before us,
                we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct
                the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the present period,
                that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received,
                for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."</p>

            <p>This excerpt from Dickens' classic novel contrasts various aspects
                of society, setting the stage for the turbulent times and complex
                themes that unfold throughout the story. It paints a vivid picture
                of the contrasting realities and conflicting emotions characterizing
                the era in which the novel is set.</p>
